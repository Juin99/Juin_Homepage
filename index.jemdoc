*About Me*\n

Welcome to my homepage!
I am a Ph.D. student of [https://msande.stanford.edu the Department of Management Science and Engineering (MS&E)] at [https://www.stanford.edu Stanford University], majoring in Operations Research.
Prior to that, I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Probability and Statistics from the [http://en.ustc.edu.cn University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)], where I won the Guo Moruo scholarship, the highest honor awarding undergraduates of USTC.

*Research Interests*\n

My research interests are primarily in designing and analyzing both robust and efficient machine learning methods, with a special focus on theoretical foundations. 
With such a goal, I work broadly across the theory and application of reinforcement learning and deep learning. 
Currently Iâ€™m also interested in large language models and its interaction with decision making.
